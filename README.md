## 📊 Enhancing Insights with Numbers  ![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0b4c540-72d6-44b1-8f2f-1b086a4b8b34)


### 1️⃣ Quantify Trip Duration Differences  
Rather than stating that customers have longer trip durations, provide exact values:  
- **Example:**  
  *"Customers have an average trip duration of **X** minutes, compared to **Y** minutes for subscribers."*  

### 2️⃣ Specify Popular Station Usage  
Instead of simply listing popular stations, include trip counts:  
- **Example:**  
  *"Market St at 10th St was the most popular start station with **X** trips."*  

### 3️⃣ Provide Age Distribution Statistics  
Go beyond just the average age and include a more detailed breakdown:  
- **Example:**  
  *"The median user age is **34** years, with **75%** of users between **25 and 45** years old. Approximately **X%** of users fall into the 'Young Adult' category."*  

### 4️⃣ Highlight Correlation Strengths  
Use correlation coefficients to measure relationships:  
- **Example:**  
  *"There is a moderate positive correlation (**r = 0.45**) between trip duration and user age."*
